# Hunting For Exoplanets In Space

The Kepler satellite-telescope has been employed by NASA to explore the depths of space to identify exoplanets. Exoplanet - a planet that orbits another star. As the Kepler telescope observes a region of space, a series light (flux) readings are recorded from starts within the field of view. These readings can be analysed to infer the possibility of an exoplanet existing within the observed region of space. This project will attempt to leverage machine learning in order to automatically classify whether a given time series of light readings has been captured in the presence of an exoplanet.
